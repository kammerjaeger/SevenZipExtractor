# How to generate the lib interfaces

 - Get the source code of the linux/windows version
 - Unpack it to p7zip into the folder SevenZipExtractor
   For the development this src was used: https://github.com/cielavenir/p7zip
 - In SevenZipExtractor.csproj uncomment the line '''<SharpGenMapping Include="LibAdapter/Mapping.xml" />'''
 - Build the project
 - Migrate any needed changes from 'LibAdapterGen' into 'LibAdapter'
	- Make sure offsets have '''x + SevenZipHandle.FuncOffset''' to accomondete the difference between linux and windows
	- Make sure ComObjectShadow reference the modified version
	- Make sure '''CallingConvention.Winapi''' is used
 - Comment the line '''<SharpGenMapping Include="LibAdapter/Mapping.xml" />''' again
 - Run build again to remove the duplicate files
